                real time facial recongition system. This system consisted of 3 core elements due to the fact that i used 
                a raspberry Pi, a facial detection system that detects the presence of a person, then a facial recognition system 
                which handles the recognition step, then what we deployed is a database and the person's images are saved on cloud. 
                To add a layer of security, we had to use the OAuth2 protocol and encrypted every communication between every system 
                using the famous RSA algorithm.
